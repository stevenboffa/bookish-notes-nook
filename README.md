## Environments (Staging & Production)

This project supports both staging and production environments for Supabase:

### Setting up Staging Environment

1. Create a new Supabase project to serve as your staging environment
2. Get your staging project anon key from the Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your staging project
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ API
   - Copy the "anon public" key
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_USE_STAGING=true
   VITE_SUPABASE_STAGING_URL=your_staging_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_STAGING_KEY=your_staging_project_anon_key
   ```

Note: The project is currently configured to use the staging environment by default.

### Testing the Environment

You can verify which environment you're using in several ways:
1. Check your browser's console for a message like: "ðŸ”Œ Supabase Environment: STAGING"
2. Look for the environment indicator in the bottom-right corner of the app (in development mode)
3. Check network requests to see which Supabase URL they're going to

### Running in Staging Mode
```sh
# Run the application using the staging environment (default)
npm run dev
```

### Running in Production Mode
```sh
# Run the application using the production environment
VITE_USE_STAGING=false npm run dev
```

### Deploying to Production

When you deploy the application:

1. For staging deployment: No additional environment variables needed (staging is default)
2. For production deployment: Set `VITE_USE_STAGING=false` in your deployment environment

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
